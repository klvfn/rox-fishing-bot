# Fishing bot for Ragnarok x Next Generation
This is a tool to automatically fishing in Ragnarok x Next Generation without using `Automatic Fishing Rod`. The idea of this bot is 
that we just see the pixel color in fishing rod coordinate continuously until we find the green one that we catch the fish.

## Important Notes
1. Currently only works on 1920 x 1080
2. There is an extra step before you can run this bot, where you have to take a screenshot when you catch a fish (fishing rod circle with a green color that show the fish is found)

## Potential Bug
1. If you have unstable internet connection, you probably can't use this bot, because it'll make the click timing miss
2. If you set the wrong screen coordinates, this bot may not work properly
